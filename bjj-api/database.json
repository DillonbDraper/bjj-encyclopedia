      "description": "The Scissor Sweep is one of the first Sweeps from Guard that most BJJ White Belts learn. And in a recent video where I covered some simple adjustments to the Keylock. Several of the White Belts that watch the channel asked for some tips on some of the really basic Brazilian Jiu-jitsu techniques that White Belts use. \n\nSo I decided to cover the Scissor Sweep since this is one of the 1st sweeps most White Belts learn. In addition, the movement used for the Scissor Sweep will be used over and over again in Brazilian Jiujitsu. Whether you’re trying to sweep of if you’re trying to open guard and transition to other positions beside the full guard. \n\nIn this video I show some simple adjustments and tweaks to the Scissor Sweep that have made this BJJ technique useable for me as a higher level belt and in addition been very helpful to many of my students. \n\nSimple things like turning the wrist over, grinding the hips up rather than simply coming up to the knees in mount have really helped.\n\nTry combining these adjustments with some of the instruction your BJJ coach teaches you at your gym. \n\nI hope this video helps your BJJ Scissor Sweep regardless of whether you're a White Belt or not. \n\nThanks for watching!\n-Chewy \n-----------------\nFree Ebook: http://www.chewjitsu.net/focused-jiu-jitsu-13-page-ebook/\n\nGrip Fighting Videos: http://www.chewjitsu.net/product/get-a-grip/\n\nT shirts: http://www.chewjitsu.net/shop/\n\nhttp://www.Facebook.com/Chewjitsu\n\nhttp://www.instagram.com/Chewjitsu\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/Chewjitsu\n\nIntro/Outtro Music : http://www.thesoundproviders.com/#/\n\nIf you’d ever like to train with the team and I.

      "description": "3 Part Lesson -- Marcelo reverses his opponent from Turtle: While protecting your neck, when you roll away from your opponent as they stay connected with a Seatbelt, land with your hips on the floor as opposed to letting them catch lower back onto their hooks. Scoop your hand under their near-side leg and connect your hands together, using the grip to help drive weight onto your opponent and spin to face them in Side Control (Reverse Side Control, North/South). [05:54] If you land on your opponent's lap after the roll, keep defending your neck as you walk your hips off of your opponent and find a way to safely reach their leg to help pull you on top with control. [09:09] If your opponent tries to pull you across to the opposite side after you've both rolled out of Turtle, they may try to take the Mount Position or reset a Back-Hook from the top if they can't pull you. Use your arm to help block the hook, but don't let it get caught in between your opponent's legs where you can make things worse by giving up the Crucifix. It's best to secure a grip on the outside of your opponent's knee and keep your arm bent while maintaining the grip.",
